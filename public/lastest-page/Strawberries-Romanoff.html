                        bowl, combine 1 cup cold heavy cream and 1/4 cup powdered sugar, and beat with an electric mixer
                        until stiff peaks form.
                        Using a spatula, fold in 1/4 cup sour cream just until well blended.
                        To serve, stir strawberries then divide between 6 serving glasses or bowls.
                        You can spoon a little syrup over the berries if you like.
                        You can also use this syrup to soak a cake.
                        Spoon cream over strawberries, dividing evenly.
                        You can also use an ice cream scoop with trigger release for a nice rounded puff of cream.
                        Serve right away or chill and enjoy within 2 hours of assembly.
