						<h2>Instructions</h2>
						<p>
							Preheat oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4 and line a baking tray with baking
							parchment. Mix the flour, sugar and baking powder in a bowl and
							rub in the cubed butter until the mixture looks like breadcrumbs,
							then mix in the dried fruit. In a clean bowl, beat the egg and
							milk together with the vanilla extract. Add the egg mixture to the
							dry ingredients and stir with a spoon until the mixture just comes
							together as a thick, lumpy dough. Add a teaspoon more milk if you
							really need it to make the mixture stick together. Place
							golfball-sized spoons of the mixture onto the prepared baking
							tray. Leave space between them as they will flatten and spread out
							to double their size during baking. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until
							golden-brown. Remove from the oven, allow to cool for a couple of
							minutes then turn them out onto a wire rack to cool.
